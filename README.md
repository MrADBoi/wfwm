I'm certain something will come of this eventually, but for now there's nothing here. Maybe if you come back later you might find something. Who knows?

The purpose of this project is to provide a highly configurable, floating window manager for Wayland, which I intend to style similarily to the default desktops of operating systems from the late 80's through mid 90's.

Check back later for more information
